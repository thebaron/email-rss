## [v1.0.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added
- **Comprehensive email body content processing**: RSS feeds now include full email message bodies with proper formatting
- **MIME multipart content cleaning**: Automatically removes MIME headers, boundaries, and encoding artifacts from email content
- **Quoted-printable decoding**: Converts encoded sequences like `=2C` (comma), `=20` (space), `=3D` (equals) to proper characters
- **UTF-8 encoding fixes**: Corrects mangled UTF-8 sequences like `Ã¢â‚¬"` â†’ `â€”` (em dash), `Ã¢â‚¬â„¢` â†’ `'` (smart quote)
- **HTML and text content detection**: Automatically handles both HTML and plain text email bodies appropriately
- **Text formatting preservation**: Plain text emails wrapped in `<pre>` tags to maintain original spacing and formatting
- **Configurable IMAP timeout**: Added timeout configuration for IMAP connections with sensible defaults
- **Enhanced message body retrieval**: Improved IMAP client to fetch both text/plain and alternative body parts
- **Comprehensive unit test suite**: Added 65.6% test coverage across core business logic components
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and linting on every commit and PR
- **Code quality tools**: Integrated golangci-lint with essential linters for code quality
- **Documentation badges**: Added CI status, test coverage, Go Report Card, and license badges
- **MIT License**: Added proper open source licensing
- **Containerization support**: Docker and Kubernetes deployment configurations
- **Debug logging**: Extensive logging for troubleshooting IMAP connections, message processing, and content conversion

### Enhanced
- **RSS feed generation**: Now includes rich email content with proper HTML formatting
- **Message deduplication**: Improved UID-based tracking to prevent duplicate messages in feeds
- **Error handling**: Enhanced error reporting with detailed context for debugging

### Fixed
- **Empty RSS descriptions**: Resolved issue where message bodies weren't being included in generated feeds
- **UID fetching**: Fixed IMAP client to properly retrieve message UIDs instead of returning zeros
- **Continuous processing**: Fixed issue where `process` command (without `--once`) wouldn't run immediately on startup
- **MIME boundary artifacts**: Cleaned up multipart message formatting that was cluttering email content
- **Character encoding issues**: Fixed display of special characters, punctuation, and international text
- **Variable shadowing**: Resolved linter warnings about variable name conflicts
- **Code formatting**: Applied consistent Go formatting across entire codebase
